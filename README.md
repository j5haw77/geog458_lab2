# Lab 2 Analysis

The tweets displayed in the map below were collected from all tweets posted in the United States around 11:19 PM PST (06:19 UTC). The spatial distribution of these tweets provides a quick (albeit unreliable) sort of pseudo-population map of the United States, since the more people there are in an area, the more likely it is that one or many of them were awake and tweeting in the middle of the night. Hence, the collected tweets are clustered around population centers, with significant groups around New England and Southern California and hardly any tweets originating in the Midwest or Alaska.

Additionally, since the location filter used in this exercise selected tweets within a rectangular boundary around the Continental United States, several tweets from Mexico and Canada were included in the data.
